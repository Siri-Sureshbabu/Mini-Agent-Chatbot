Cybersecurity awareness focuses on educating users about common cyber threats such as phishing, malware, ransomware, and social engineering attacks. 
Human error remains one of the leading causes of security breaches across organizations.

Basic security practices include using strong passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and avoiding suspicious links or email attachments. 
Organizations often conduct regular training sessions and simulated phishing campaigns to improve employee awareness.

With the rise of remote work and cloud-based systems, cybersecurity awareness has become a shared responsibility between IT teams and end users. 
Well-documented security guidelines help reduce risk and improve organizational resilience.
