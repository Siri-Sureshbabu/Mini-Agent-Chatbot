Product management involves guiding a product from concept to launch and beyond. 
Product managers act as a bridge between engineering, design, marketing, and business teams to ensure the product meets user needs and business objectives.

Key responsibilities include defining product vision, gathering user requirements, prioritizing features, and tracking performance metrics. 
Successful product management relies on data-driven decision-making and continuous user feedback.

Agile methodologies are commonly used in product development to enable faster iteration and adaptability. 
A well-defined product roadmap helps teams align their efforts and manage stakeholder expectations effectively.
