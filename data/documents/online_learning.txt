Online learning platforms have transformed the way education is delivered across the world. 
Early digital learning systems focused primarily on recorded video lectures, but modern platforms now offer interactive assessments, real-time doubt resolution, and AI-driven personalization.

Most platforms provide course tracking, certification, and skill-based learning paths. 
Learners benefit from flexible schedules, self-paced modules, and access to global instructors. 
Institutions use analytics dashboards to monitor learner progress and improve content effectiveness.

Security and data privacy have become critical considerations, especially as platforms collect personal data and learning behavior metrics. 
As a result, many providers invest in secure authentication systems and encrypted data storage.
